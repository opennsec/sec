# Overview 

In this lesson, we will be exploring the fundamentals of networking. We will look at network topology, how data is created, the OSI -TCP/IP stack, identifying different devices in a network, and understanding how different networks create the internet.

# The fundamentals of networking

The fact that you're here means that you probably already know that when most ***CEO's*** are asked what is the top of mind for them ***cybersecurity*** or ***information security*** is always in top ten items.
