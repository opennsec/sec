# Overview 

In this lesson, we will be exploring the fundamentals of networking. We will look at network topology, how data is created, the OSI -TCP/IP stack, identifying different devices in a network, and understanding how different networks create the internet.

# The fundamentals of networking

The fact that you're here means that you probably already know that when most ***CEO's*** are asked what is the top of mind for them ***cybersecurity*** or ***information security*** is always in top ten items.

Whether it is a large company or a startup protecting the information assets, brand, intellectual property (IP) and their clients or customers is a big concern for all. 

And it should be because it's fast as cybersecurity solutions have grown. We think it's a good idea to start with each lesson with a roadmap of what we will cover in this 

# Objectives

1. [Intro to networking and the language of networking](#Introduction-to-networking)
2. [Discuss network data transmission](#Network-data-transmission)
3. [Examine network topologies](#Network-topologies)


## Introduction to networking

**What is computer network?**

So what exactly is ***computer networking***. Well, it could described as a pool of connected network devices communicating with one another and sharing data ad resources. **e.g** laptops, desktops, servers etc.


**The Language of networking**

There are many ***terminologies*** when it comes to networking. But there are a few that people who work in computer networking would use on a daily basis a kind of CNL (computer networking language) if you will.

* ***Packets***

  The first word that you're going to get used to hearing a lot is the word **packet**. Basically packets are the segments of data. A packet generically contains useful information that helps the transmission ***from source to destination*** in a network.

* ***Ethernet***

  ***fig. ethernet cable***

  Ethernet is a standardized technology for connecting devices in a ***Local Area Network*** (LAN) or ***Wide Area Network*** (WAN) with ethernet cables. Basically it aids communication between devices sending resources.

Ofcourse, there are many terms that we're assuming you already know.

* ***What's the difference between a WAN and LAN***

  There are the very obvious ones like ***Internet*** and ***world wide web (WWW)*** that are too obivous to even talk about and then there are others like ***LAN*** and ***WAN*** that computer geeks use all the time, assuming people what they mean. So just checking what we are talking about and more importantly what's the difference between LAN and WAN.


  A ***LAN*** is a local area network that covers a small geographic area **e.g** Home, office or building while, a ***WAN*** is a wide area network that covers a broader area **e.g** A city or region etc.

* ***Domain Name System (DNS)***

  <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/DNSServers-891f522f2bc2469088df0a11dd687611.jpg" alt="image" width="70%" height="auto">

  DNS is a *hierarchical naming system* that translates domain names to IP addresses, with the help of the fully qualified domain name.

* ***Internet Messaging Program (IMP)***

  <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/ec9sv1x6.png" alt="image" width="70%" height="auto">

  ***IMP*** is a web-based email system that allows the upload of data to an existing web server. IMP was first used when data was transmitted on ***ARPANET*** one of the earliest wide area networks.

* ***Firewall***

  <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/firewall.jpg" alt="image" width="70%" height="auto">

  A *firewall* is the first-line of defense in a network it helps in monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic with set instructions a firewall could decide to ***allow*** or ***deny*** or ***blocks*** specific traffic.

* ***Protocols*** 

  <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/oplroxtd.png" alt="image" width="70%" height="auto">

  Protocols are the ***set of rules or regulations*** used by connected devices to communicate over a network. 

  It can be said that the ***protocols*** are **digital languages** that are implemented in the form of ***network algorithms***. There are many different protocols and we cover most of them in the summary for this lesson. 

    * ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***

      <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/1_EdNbSLZEbyr1EbUBZE-DIw.jpg" alt="image" width="80%" height="auto">

      ***TCP*** is one of the protocols that is often used in communication in networking.

      It is a ***reliable*** protocol that uses a ***three-way handshake*** to verify connectivity before data is sent. It is used in ***email file sharing*** and ***downloading over the internet***.

    * ***User Datagram Protocol***

      <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/60wd77xb.png" alt="image" width="80%" height="auto">

      <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/TCP-vs-UDP.webp" alt="image" width="80%" height="auto">

      ***UDP*** is a protocol used in networking where a higher speed of transmission is required and data loss tolerance is low.

      UDP works particularly while in network communications such as **i.e.,** voice calls, domain name systems (DNS), DNS lookup and video streaming. 

    * ***Internet Protocol (IP)*** 

      <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/internet-protocol-ip-n.jpg" alt="image" width="80%" height="auto">

      ***IP*** works as a *unique identifier* for a network device.

      The ***data*** or ***packet*** is enclosed with the sender IP and the recipient IP addresses to make it easier to locate the recipient address.

    * ***Internet Control Messages Protocol (ICMP)***

      <img src="https://github.com/opennsec/sec/blob/main/module%201/lesson%201%20/img/hlq6bohu.png" alt="image" width="80%" height="auto">

      ***ICMP*** is one of the most commonly used protocols when it comes to *error checking* and communication reports between two hosts.
